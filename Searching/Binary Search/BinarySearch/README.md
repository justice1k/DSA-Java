## Getting Started

In the Main-class, `public static int binarySearch(ArrayList<Book> books, int searchedId)`, searches the list it received as a parameter, for a book with an id variable that matches the value of searchedId variable it received as a parameter. If that book is found the method, it returns the index it's located at, in the list it received as a parameter. If the book isn't found, the method should return the value -1.

The method is implemented as a binary search, which assumes the list is ordered.
